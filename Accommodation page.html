  <h1> Accommodation for students in Aberystwyth </h1>

  <div class="Uniresidences">
    <p>Finding suitable accommodation is an essential thing for every student. This will be your new home for at least one year, so you have to feel comfortable in this place. Aberystwyth students, regardless which academic year, have access to a wide range of university residences. Prices starts from £86 per week, and bills are included in this cost. This is a great deal if you are interested in sports, because residents have a free gym membership to the Aber Sport Centre, or want quick access to the University campus.

   <p>   Another option is accommodation in the private sector. Aberystwyth is a typical student town so it has a big and developed market of properties. You have various options: from renting an apartment for just yourself (e.g. studios to single rooms) to living with your friends (e.g. property agencies often offer houses (usually bills included) with multiple rooms). Prices usually start from £100 per week for a one-person flat to £60 per week for a room in a shared house. If you want to start your search now, there are a plenty of groups like "Aberystwyth Renting Houses" and "Housing Aberystwyth" on Facebook. If you are not British, you can always look for special Facebook groups with people only from your country who live or are moving to Aberystwyth. This is also an amazing opportunity to make new friends! When you have picked a place, you can text, email or pop in to one of the various Aberystwyth property agencies.
